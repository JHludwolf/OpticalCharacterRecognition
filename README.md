# OpticalCharacterRecognition
Back in 2020, when virtual classes were "the thing", we started taking screenshots of every powerpoint there was instead of taking notes, but then I discover a OCR app, which allowed me to get the text out of my images.
Unfortunately the app started charging and as a student I couldn't afford it, so I made my own. 

My OCR tool takes an image from the clipboard as input and instantaneously gets the text ready to paste.
